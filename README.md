Last commit "Update file path": couldn't get vscode to find file without absolute or relative path and it won't run in the command line with the relative path. I changed it to be just the file name "HistoricalQuotes.csv". So now it works normally from the command line, but if you try to run it in vscode for some reason, you need to modify the "file name" to "StockApp/HistoricalQuotes.csv".
